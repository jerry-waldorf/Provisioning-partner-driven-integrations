# Azure Active Directory Partner Driven Integrations

Azure Active Directory provides a SCIM client that can provision users and groups into various applications such as Dropbox, Snowflake, and Workplace by Facebook. Several partners have built integrations on top of the Azure AD provisioning service that provide connectivity to applications that do not support the SCIM standard (e.g. SAP, SQL, LDAP, etc.). This document serves as a place for partners to attest to integrations that are compatible with Azure Active Directory and for customers to discover these additional integration options.
