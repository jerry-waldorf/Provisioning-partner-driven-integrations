The Azure Active Directory provisoining service currently supports a SCIM client that can provision users and groups into various applications such as Dropbox, Snowflake, and Workplace by Facebook. We have a growing library of connectors to applications that you can use out of the box. In addition to the applications that we support out of the box, a number of partners have built integrations on top of the Azure AD provisioning service that provide connectivity to various applications. This doc provides a list of partners that have developed and tested integrations with our provisioning service.
